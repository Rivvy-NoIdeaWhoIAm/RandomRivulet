i do not know how to write terms of service, so uh, here goes? i'll just be honest on how this works ig

By agreeing to use this bot, you agree not to claim any art that **you have not created** as your own. Any images added to this bot are guaranteed to be given proper credit, so far as the bot refusing to send an image if it is unable to provide credit. If you would like an image,
or any of your art in general, removed from the bot, you can contact <@1205957884991766628> on Discord (Reyvi/noideawhoiam3855). I (as the creator of RandomRivulet, and creator of the QuickCredit system for embeded image crediting) heavily recommend viewing the original posts of
artwork shown, please show the artists some love. This bot comes with a built-in leaderboard, allowing you to compare statistics (total unique fish found and total uses) with other users.
I do not claim any artwork as my own unless explicitly stated by the bot, and on rare occasions, there may be mixed up files, in which case the wrong artist is credited (such as in the case of a repost). All art shown is sourced from public sources, being posted publicly or explicitly
asked to be included in the bot.

If you would like an image to be removed, I would prefer you reach out to me directly. If you'd prefer, you can have someone ask on your behalf, but I'd like to at least be able to confirm you're the artist. You can also @ me on Tumblr if 
it is preferred, although I do not have a public Twitter/X account. If there are multiple artworks of yours in the bot, then I can remove all of them if you request it.
*Artwork removal can also be requested by the creator of the Rivulet design, if you aren't comfortable with it in the bot.

I apologize if there is any distress caused due to used artworks without permission. It is not my intent to make people uncomfortable, nor is it my intent to gain popularity/credit for any images found here that aren't mine.
